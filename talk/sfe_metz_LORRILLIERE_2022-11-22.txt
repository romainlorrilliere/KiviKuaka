Hi everyone, 
Thank you for being there. 
I will take about the interaction of a small shorebird, the wandering tattler, on a tiny Polynesian island. 
---
The shorebirds are the species you can easily see and recognize during the winter when large flocks fly together and frenetically forage in the mud. 
---
Among the birds, the shorebirds are a taxon, particularly on the threat, with about 40 % of species in decline. They face many human-induced threats, such as  climatic change, degradation and destruction of stopover shore habitat, agricultural intensification, pollution and disease, and eutrophication, and some natural threat, such as tsunamis, storms, volcanism, and earthquake.
---
The shorebirds are long-distance migratory species, especially in the pacific basin where the ocean is a huge barrier. 
Consequently, the nutritional quality of stopover sites and wintering areas are significant drivers of breeding productivity. 
In tropical areas, the available resources are known to be limited. 
And these limitation drive competition, which is the major driver of shorebird survival during the winter. 
---
Hence, some species have territorial behaviour even during the winter. It is especially the case for the species that are visual feeders and detect their prey over a large area, such as the plovers, some sandpipers and the tattlers. 
---
This knowledge is often from studies about wintering on mudflats and wetlands in Europe, Asia, South America, Australia, and New Zealand.
Hence the tidal effects on habitat used, the pollution effects on feed resources productivity and the interaction effect between the many species that feed on the same mudflat are broadly documented. 
---
Despite the absence of these productive habitats on the many reef islands in the pacific ocean, there are wintering shorebirds. 
So, for conservation issues, it seems essential to understand how the birds interact on these reefed islands for feed.
---
Here we have the main question: What is the spatial structuration of a territorial shorebird population on a reefed island? 
We expect a significant overlap of bird home ranges, but the birds should stay away from each other. 
---
The study site is a tiny island named Tikei of the Tuamotu archipelago in French Polynesia. 
This island is far for 70 km from the closest island. Its dimension is 3.9 km in length and 1.6 km in width for an area of 4.5 square km and 9 km of coast. 
---
We found on it 4 habitats, from the centre to the ocean, the tallest the forest, then the bush, the beach and finally the reef. 
---
On Tikei, there is a wintering population of wandering tattlers. It is a small shorebird, about 110 grammes. 
It breeds in rocky places in the mountain valley of North America and is broadly distributed in the pacific area for wintering. There is not much information about its wintering, but some observations suggest that they are territorial, as this observation of two birds which share equally 700m of the coast. 
---
We stayed on Tikei for 24 hours in January 2021. 
During the day, we estimated that 25 wandering tattlers lived on Tikei
(that corresponds to one bird for 350m coast too)
During the night, We traped 17 birds, mainly with bell-shaped nets and powerful light and someone with mist nets, 
We equipped them with a 5g Icarus PPT tag with a leg-loop harness.
---
Icarus is a Max Plank intiative. 
The beacons sent data by a VHF signal via a Russian antenna on the ISS that flights at low altitudes, but they were some constraints on
communication (such as the time windows) 
The initial purpose of this project is to create a network for monitoring the movement of animals.
---
Unfortunately, since march 2022, the system no longer functions due to the cessation of collaboration between Max Planck and the Russian space agency in response to the military invasion.
---
So, we fitted 17 wandering tattler
with GPS tags. 
But only 13 have sent data. We can discuss the reasons for these problems later.  
Furthermore, the data acquisition
was irregular and,
unfortunately, stopped
pretty quickly. 
---
Here are all the locations that we gathered. But if we break data by week, we observe that they are very fragmented. Despite that, and thank the constraints of the ISS time windows, we get many synchronous data. 
We get more than 3000 pairs of synchronous data, with less than 2
minutes between the two locations.
---
The location data are suitable for estimating home ranges (or areas used by individuals). 
To assess them, we used the adehabitat R package. 
And as recommended for the small sample, we assess an individual
ad-hoc H parameter for which the 95% isoline forms a single simple
polygon. 
---
For each bird, we search the H parameter by a trial-and-error algorithm to get a 95% isoline that forms a single simple polygon. 
For example, here is the result of the process for a bird. 
---
The kernels are only smooth on location. However, we could improve the home range according to the habitats used. Indeed except for the tattler T06, which uses the habitat in the same proporition of their area (last line), all other birds avoid forest. 
Consequently, we intersect the home ranges with the used habitats (the reef, the beach, and the bush). 
---
Finally, we get this kind of home ranges for the isoline 50% and 95%. You can observe that the overlaps are large with the isoline 95%.
---
To study if the bird interacts, we assess the distance between birds when the lag between the locations is less than 2 minutes.
We compare this distance with a control group with a lag from 2 hours to 2 days.
To observe the effect of interaction levels between birds on these
distances, we classify the pairs according to the minimum isoline at
which the birds overlap.
---
The result that I will show you as organised like that. Vertically you have the distance between the bird, and horizontally an indicator of the overlap of the home range of the bird pairs, at the left bird pairs, whose home range overlap is large and at the right birds, with almost no overlap in their home ranges. 
Finally, we compare the distance for synchronous location, less than 2 minutes between the location with the control distances. 
---
If we consider the isoline as a continuous variable with the circadian time as a random variable. 
---
We could observe that birds are, in mean, not so close.
Even when their home range overlap is large, birds are not close
So, birds seem to be not social 
But when the birds' overlap increases, they seem closer when
locations are synchronous rather than randomised locations.
This difference could be the result of the behaviour of territoriality,
vigilance and aggressivity among the other bird.
Interestingly, this difference seems to be an indicator of the cost of the competition.
---
Despite a large overlap in home range, the Tikei wandering tattler
appears to be territorial.
But this overlap of home ranges seems to come at a cost to the
birds, probably through the time spent watching and defending their
territory.
---
Despite fragmented data on the location of the birds
we show an interesting example of birds interacting on a small isolated island.
