abstract = {LARGE numbers of shorebirds that breed in North America spend the winter in the region of the Bay of Paracas, 150 miles south of Lima, Peru. During a short period in October and November 1965 I had the oppor-tunity to observe some aspects of the feeding behavior of mixed flocks of two very similar species, the Semipalmated Sandpiper (Ereunetes pusillus) and the Western Sandpiper (E. mauri), which has a considerably longer bill. They were feeding in a small harbor-like inlet with a narrow entrance, situated at La Puntilia, Pisco, about 2 miles north of the Bay of Paracas. The tides caused important changes in this habitat, and th'ese varied con-siderably from day to day; the lowest tides virtually emptied the inlet, while the highest of the low tides left the inlet bottom at least one third covered with water. At low tide, three zones could be distinguished; water, wet mud (shiny), and dry mud (dull). These zones are presumably equiva-lent respectively to zones D and E, zone B, and zone A in Figure 3 in Recher's study of the feeding of shorebirds (Ecology, 47: 393-407, 1966). The extent of the three zones changed continually as the water flowed in and out of the inlet, and as wet mud dried on the outgoing tide and dry mud became wet mud on the incoming tide. The numbers of birds in the inlet varied from day to day; in late Oc-tober and the first half of November there were usually between 20 and 100 Semipalmated Sandpipers (average 33) and between 3 and 40 Western Sandpipers (average 8). The Western Sandpipers were frequently in two or three loose groups within the flock of Semipalmated Sandpipers, and the two species fed over the same general area, frequently only a meter or so apart. I noticed only occasional inter-or intraspecific aggression. My objective was to determine the extent to which these two species differ in their exploitation of the feeding habitat. As close as possible to the time of low tide, I made a series of counts of the flock in quick suc-cession, noting first how many of each species were in water, th'en how many were on wet mud, and finally how many were on dry mud. Birds at the boundaries of the defined substrates were ignored, for instance birds standing on wet mud but feeding in water. These counts were repeated several times on each of 6 days. The totals for each day (Table 1) show that on most days the highest percentage of both species fed on wet mud. On all days the Western Sandpiper tended to be relatively more abundant in water, and the Semipalmated Sandpiper to be more abundant on dry mud. The consistency of this trend indicates a real difference in zone},

abstract = {1. Researchers often attach transmitters and other devices to free-living birds without a clear understanding of potential deleterious consequences to their study organisms, and thus to their data. Studies investigating this topic have generally been limited to a single species or type of device. 2. To achieve a broader understanding we used a meta-analysis of 84 studies to ask: (1) Do devices have an overall effect on birds? (2) Which aspects of avian behaviour and ecology are affected? (3) What attributes of birds influence transmitter effects? (4) What attributes of devices influence their effects? (5) Are effects partially a consequence of capture and restraint? 3. We found a significant negative effect of devices on birds, both overall and for 8 of the 12 specific aspects analysed. The most substantial effects were that birds with devices had markedly increased energy expenditure and were much less likely to nest. 4. Effects were independent of attributes of the birds (sex, age, primary method of locomotion and body mass). We also found no evidence that proportionally heavier devices had greater effects, although researchers generally avoided using heavy devices. Breast-mounted and harness attachments increased device-induced behaviours such as preening, however, and the risk of device-induced mortality differed between attachment methods. 5. Other than foraging behaviours, no effects were a consequence of capture or restraint. 6. Synthesis and applications. We provide the first comprehensive evidence that transmitters and other devices negatively affect birds and may bias resulting data. Researchers should balance the benefits of using these techniques against potential costs to the birds and reliability of the data obtained.},

abstract = {I reviewed species accounts and the primary literature for 215 shorebirds to provide an up-dated review of the occurrence of territoriality during the non-breeding season. In total, 52 species have been recorded defending territories. From the primary literature I, found 78 reports of territoriality in42 species, most of which w ere plovers and lapwings (n=14), calidridine sandpipers (n=11), tringine sandpipers (n=11), and curlews (n=4); it has also been reported in ten other species. Among higher taxa, territoriality is most prevalent in tringine (65% of species) and calidridine (46%) sandpipers. Territoriality occurs regularly in some species (e .g., Numenius spp., Pluvialis spp.), whereas it has not been reported or does not occur in 163 species. Of 69 published accounts in the primary literature, most (69%) were from latitudes greater than 30{\o} north (43%) and south (26%), but this maybe attributable to sampling effort. Duration of defence varied from hours to months (e.g., Calidris alba); individual of some species returned annually to the same territory (e.g.,Pluvialis squatarola, Numenius arquata) or were resident year-round (e.g., Haematopus bachmani). Size o f territories varied from a few metres along river shores (e .g., Tringa glareola) to several hectares (e .g., Numenius); larger species tended to defend larger territories. Territoriality occurs mostly in species that detect prey visually.},

  abstract = {Many shorebirds are Nearctic-Neotropical migrants that move from their northern breeding grounds to wintering areas in Central and South America. Shorebirds differ from many other groups of avian migrants by their extremely long and demanding flights, gregariousness, restriction to limited numbers of sites, long lifespans, and low recruitment. Migration monitoring data suggest that population declines are occurring in shorebirds that breed in North America, and non-breeding habitat loss is thought to be a contributing factor. Considerable habitat loss and degradation from anthropogenic activities have influenced wetlands across the shorebird non-breeding range. If we wish to predict the consequences of habitat loss for shorebird populations, we must not only quantify changes in available habitat area, but also understand the role of density-dependence as populations pack into or expand from areas, as demonstrated for European shorebird population parameters. In contrast, little is known about the population or behavioral ecology of the wintering shorebirds south of the United States. We briefly review of the state of knowledge of the effects of habitat loss on shorebirds during the non-breeding season in the Neotropics, illustrated with several examples, to highlight the many unanswered questions. It is crucial to gain better understanding of population limiting factors in this region because shorebird populations are influenced by habitat alterations across the non-breeding range. The relative importance of non-breeding vs breeding season density-dependence remains to be assessed for most species.},

  abstract  = {Wetland loss has driven negative effects on biodiversity by a reduction in potential available habitats, directly impacting wetland-dependent species such as migratory shorebirds. At coastal areas where tidal cycles can restrict food access, the degree to which density of foraging birds is mediated by conspecific abundance or by the available areas is crucial to understanding patterns of bird distribution and wetland carrying capacity. We used the bathymetry of two sectors modeled with two numerical matrices to determine the availability of intertidal foraging areas in relation to tidal level (spring and neap tides), and this information was used to estimate shorebird density and foraging activity throughout the low-tide cycle in a tropical coastal lagoon in northwestern Mexico. Relative to spring tides, an 80% reduction in available foraging areas occurred during neap tides. Overall shorebird abundance was significantly reduced during neap tide periods, with differences between species. Densities of shorebirds increased during neap tides, particularly in one sector, and remained similar throughout the low-tide period (i.e. 4 h) either during spring or neap tides. Time spent foraging was consistently lower during neap-tides relative to spring-tides, especially for Long-billed curlew (44% reduction), Willet (37% reduction) and Black-necked stilt (29% reduction). These decreases in foraging activity when available habitats became reduced can hamper the opportunities of migratory shorebirds to reach their daily energy requirements to survive during the non-breeding season. This study shows that when intertidal habitats are severely reduced an important fraction of shorebird populations would probably be forced to find alternative areas to forage or increase foraging time during the night. Serving an essential function as top-predators, these results can have important implications on carrying capacity assessment for shorebirds at coastal wetlands.},

  abstract = {1. In migratory species, early arrival on the breeding grounds can often enhance breeding success. Timing of spring migration is therefore a key process that is likely to be influenced both by factors specific to individuals, such as the quality of winter and breeding locations and the distance between them, and by annual variation in weather conditions before and during migration. 2. The Icelandic black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa islandica population is currently increasing and, throughout Iceland, is expanding into poorer quality breeding areas. Using a unique data set of arrival times in Iceland in different years for individuals of known breeding and wintering locations, we show that individuals breeding in lower quality, recently occupied and colder areas arrive later than those from traditionally occupied areas. The population is also expanding into new wintering areas, and males from traditionally occupied winter sites also arrive earlier than those occupying novel sites. 3. Annual variation in timing of migration of individuals is influenced by large-scale weather systems (the North Atlantic Oscillation), but between-individual variation is a stronger predictor of arrival time than the NAO. Distance between winter and breeding sites does not influence arrival times. 4. Annual variation in timing of migration is therefore influenced by climatic factors, but the pattern of individual arrival is primarily related to breeding and winter habitat quality. These habitat effects on arrival patterns are likely to operate through variation in individual condition and local-scale density-dependent processes. Timing of migration thus appears to be a key component of the intricate relationship between wintering and breeding grounds in this migratory system. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {Most shorebirds depend on coastal habitats for much of their life cycle. The quality and diversity of feeding areas during the wintering period directly condition their winter survival, subsequent migration, and breeding success. During their wintering in France, shorebirds use intertidal areas for feeding, both in daylight and at night, depending on the availability of mudflats during the tidal cycle. In this context, we studied whether the bar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica) shows contrasting foraging behaviors and distributions between day and night in response to differences in visual capacities, prey availability, potential predation risk, and human activities. We carried out a fine-scale GPS tracking of birds at one of their main wintering sites along the French Atlantic coast. We predicted smaller foraging home ranges at night because of limits for godwits to detect prey visually, suggesting more sediment probing and less movement. Godwits used the entire time window when they have access to intertidal areas, but they faithfully selected distinct diurnal and nocturnal feeding areas using a low number of patches. This variability in space use highlights differences in selection of habitats, such as seagrass beds selected by most of the tracked godwits by day and used much less at night. In addition, distinct feeding distributions of monitored birds revealed interindividual variability in habitat selection, even more by night, most likely to reduce intraspecific competition. We therefore urge greater consideration of the night distribution of birds, rarely evaluated in shorebird studies, to define areas and habitats of importance to future management and conservation measures.},

Technological advances have led to an explosion in sensor-based methods for remotely observing these phenomena. This transition to big data creates new challenges for data management, analysis and collaboration.


We present the Movebank ecosystem of tools used by thousands of researchers to collect, manage, share, visualize, analyse and archive their animal tracking and other animal-borne sensor data. Users add sensor data through file uploads or live data streams and further organize and complete quality control within the Movebank system. All data are harmonized to a data model and vocabulary. The public can discover, view and download data for which they have been given access to through the website, the Animal Tracker mobile app or by API. Advanced analysis tools are available through the EnvDATA System, the MoveApps platform and a variety of user-developed applications. Data owners can share studies with select users or the public, with options for embargos, licenses and formal archiving in a data repository.


Movebank is used by over 3,100 data owners globally, who manage over 6 billion animal location and sensor measurements across more than 6,500 studies, with thousands of active tags sending over 3 million new data records daily. These data underlie >700 published papers and reports. We present a case study demonstrating the use of Movebank to assess life-history events and demography, and engage with citizen scientists to identify mortalities and causes of death for a migratory bird.


A growing number of researchers, government agencies and conservation organizations use Movebank to manage research and conservation projects and to meet legislative requirements. The combination of historic and new data with collaboration tools enables broad comparative analyses and data acquisition and mapping efforts. Movebank offers an integrated system for real-time monitoring of animals at a global scale and represents a digital museum of animal movement and behaviour. Resources and coordination across countries and organizations are needed to ensure that these data, including those that cannot be made public, remain accessible to future generations.},

@article{Keeping2014,
abstract = {Counting animals to estimate their population sizes is often essential for their management and conservation. Since practitioners frequently rely on indirect observations of animals, it is important to better understand the relationship between such indirect indices and animal abundance. The Formozov-Malyshev-Pereleshin (FMP) formula provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the relationship between animal track counts and the true density of species. Although this analytical method potentially has universal applicability wherever animals are readily detectable by their tracks, it has long been unique to Russia and remains widely underappreciated. In this paper, we provide a test of the FMP formula by isolating the influence of animal travel path tortuosity (i.e., convolutedness) on track counts. We employed simulations using virtual and empirical data, in addition to a field test comparing FMP estimates with independent estimates from line transect distance sampling. We verify that track counts (total intersections between animals and transects) are determined entirely by density and daily movement distances. Hence, the FMP estimator is theoretically robust against potential biases from specific shapes or patterns of animal movement paths if transects are randomly situated with respect to those movements (i.e., the transects do not influence animals' movements). However, detectability (the detection probability of individual animals) is not determined simply by daily travel distance but also by tortuosity, so ensuring that all intersections with transects are counted regardless of the number of individual animals that made them becomes critical for an accurate density estimate. Additionally, although tortuosity has no bearing on mean track encounter rates, it does affect encounter rate variance and therefore estimate precision. We discuss how these fundamental principles made explicit by the FMP formula have widespread implications for methods of assessing animal abundance that rely on indirect observations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Keeping, Pelletier.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in animal tracking and telemetry technology have allowed the collection of location data at an ever-increasing rate and accuracy, and these advances have been accompanied by the development of new methods of data analysis for portraying space use, home ranges and utilization distributions. New statistical approaches include data-intensive techniques such as kriging and nonlinear generalized regression models for habitat use. In addition, mechanistic home-range models, derived from models of animal movement behaviour, promise to offer new insights into how home ranges emerge as the result of specific patterns of movements by individuals in response to their environment. Traditional methods such as kernel density estimators are likely to remain popular because of their ease of use. Large datasets make it possible to apply these methods over relatively short periods of time such as weeks or months, and these estimates may be analysed using mixed effects models, offering another approach to studying temporal variation in space-use patterns. Although new technologies open new avenues in ecological research, our knowledge of why animals use space in the ways we observe will only advance by researchers using these new technologies and asking new and innovative questions about the empirical patterns they observe. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

We describe a new leg-loop harness technique that we employed with mixed success on two polar-nesting seabirds: South Polar Skuas Catharacta maccormicki and Northern Fulmars Fulmarus glacialis. The appropriateness of this or any harness package is species-specific, and we experienced differing results-the leg-loop harness performed satisfactorily with skuas, but nest abandonment and probable adult mortality were the rule in fulmars. We believe the leg-loop design offers a suitable alternative to chest harnesses for some species and telemetry applications.},

The condition index of previously banded or subsequently recovered birds captured in Iceland was positively related to the number of summers they were known to have survived. Body stores carried from the last spring staging area to the breeding grounds appear to offer Arctic-breeding shorebirds significant selective advantages: they are used for physical transformation from migration to breeding condition, and in years when weather is difficult may enable survival after arrival on the breeding grounds. {\textcopyright} Journal of Avian Biology.},

Four major groups can be recognized: North American migrants residing in coastal Buenos Aires Province during their non‐breeding season, Patagonian species wintering locally but breeding further south, Pampean species breeding locally, and Brazil–Paraguayan species present during their breeding season. Because of differences among these groups in the timing and migration patterns, community composition shows marked seasonal variation. Both nesting and non‐breeding birds use a diversity of habitat types ranging from littoral sandy beaches to upland grasslands. Throughout the year, however, and in all habitat types, non‐breeders predominate in species number and abundance. Intra‐ and inter‐specific patterns of aggression suggest both that resources are limiting, and that non‐breeding migrants may play an important role in determining breeding community composition.

abstract = {Macrozoobenthic communities of intertidal soft sediments are reviewed worldwide from the perspective of a mollusc-eating shorebird species. Based on 19 sites, total biomass figures varied between 5 and 80 g AFDM per m2 (average 24 g AFDM per m2); no latitudinal trends are apparent. The contribution made by bivalves and gastropods varies between 1% and 99%, north-temperate intertidal flats having relatively more molluscs than tropical flats. Intertidal flats in the tropics contain a greater variety of taxa, with brachiopods in Indonesia and echinoderms in northwest Australia contributing significantly to biomass only there. Limits to the occurrence of avian predators of intertidal benthos are set by the harvestable fraction of the biomass on offer and the costs of living at a particular site. No systematic differences in the harvestable fraction of the total mollusc-biomass for a worldwide occurring shorebird species specializing on molluscs (knots Calidris canutus) were apparent between temperate and tropical intertidal areas, in spite of large differences in maintenance metabolism incurred by these birds. The harvestable fractions of bivalves in the two West African areas (Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau) tended to be high (23-84% of total biomass in six species), they were relatively low (2-52% in five species) in the temperate Wadden Sea and the tropical northwest Australian site. Harvestable biomass determines the intake rate of shorebirds, as illustrated by functional-response curves of knots feeding on two bivalves species. We argue that the collection of information on size-depth relationships along with faunal and biomass surveys at a range of sites is bound to greatly increase our understanding of both the biology of tidal-flat invertebrates and the resource base underpinning the spectacular seasonal migrations of shorebirds. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

  abstract = {The Pacific Basin, by virtue of its vastness and its complex aeroscape, provides unique opportunities to address questions about the behavioral and physiological capabilities and mechanisms through which birds can complete spectacular flights. No longer is the Pacific seen just as a formidable barrier between terrestrial habitats in the north and the south, but rather as a gateway for specialized species, such as shorebirds, to make a living on hemispherically distributed seasonal resources. This recent change in perspective is dramatic, and the research that underpins it has presented new opportunities to learn about phenomena that often challenge a sense of normal. Ancient Polynesians were aware of the seasonal passage of shorebirds and other landbirds over the Pacific Ocean, incorporating these observations into their navigational “tool kit” as they explored and colonized the Pacific. Some ten centuries later, systematic visual observations and tracking technology have revealed much about movement of these shorebirds, especially the enormity of their individual nonstop flights. This invites a broad suite of questions, often requiring comparative studies with bird migration across other ocean basins, or across continents. For example, how do birds manage many days of nonstop exercise apparently without sleep? What mechanisms explain birds acting as if they possess a Global Positioning System? How do such extreme migrations evolve? Through advances in both theory and tracking technology, biologists are poised to greatly expand the horizons of movement ecology as we know it. In this integrative review, we present a series of intriguing questions about trans-Pacific migrant shorebirds and summarize recent advances in knowledge about migratory behavior operating at temporal scales ranging from immediate decisions during a single flight, to adaptive learning throughout a lifetime, to evolutionary development of migratory pathways. Recent advances in this realm should stimulate future research across the globe and across a broad array of disciplines.},

  abstract = {The loss of feeding areas may pose a threat to many wintering waders because increased competition arising from reduced foraging space may force birds either to emigrate or to die. This has been demonstrated to occur in northwest European estuaries, but virtually no studies have been performed in the estuaries of southern Europe, where the loss of supratidal habitats (salines and saltmarshes), rather than intertidal habitats, are currently the main threat to waders' habitats. If these habitats are lost, waders may be forced to move to the intertidal mudflats, perhaps increasing competition between individuals and ultimately leading to starvation or emigration. We tested this hypothesis in the Mondego estuary, a small estuary on Portugal's west coast, which is presently under heavy human pressure. We used indirect methods to test for the occurrence of both components of intra-specific competition: interference and prey depletion. We found no evidence that either interference or depletion competition was occurring at present, either on the mudflats or in the salines. Overall, the results suggest that the intertidal mudflats may still be able to accommodate birds displaced from the destroyed supratidal salines, but modelling is required to predict the effect that the combined loss of feeding area and foraging time that this would entail would have on their fitness, and thus numbers. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

We evaluated variation in home-range estimates with location data collected from GPS collars on two species: mule deer Odocoileus hemionus and coyotes Canis latrans. We calculated home ranges using 95% and 50% kernel contours using reference (h-ref and h ad hoc smoothing parameters. To evaluate the influence of sample size, we calculated home ranges using both smoothing parameters for random subsamples of 5, 10, 25 and 50% of GPS locations and compared area estimates to estimates for 100% of GPS locations. On mule deer, we also conducted visual relocations using conventional radiotelemetry, which resulted in fewer locations than GPS collars. Area was overestimated at smaller sample sizes, but an interesting pattern was noted with higher relative bias at 60-100 locations than at sample sizes < 50 locations. Relative bias was most likely due to increased smoothing of outer data points. Subsampling allowed us to examine relative bias across a range of samples sizes for the two smoothing parameters. Minimum number of points to obtain a consistent home range estimates varied by smoothing method, species, study duration, and volume contour (95% or 50%). While h-ad hoc performed consistently better over most sample sizes, there may not be a universal recommendation for all studies and species. Behavioral traits resulting in concentrated or disparate space use complicates comparisons among and between species. We suggest researchers examine their point distribution, justify their choice of smoothing parameter, and report their choices for home-range analysis based on their study objectives.},

abstract = {Limited knowledge of the distribution, abundance, and habitat associations of migratory species hinders effective conservation actions. We use Neotropical migratory birds as a model group to compare approaches to prioritize land conservation needed to support ≥30% of the global abundances of 117 species. Specifically, we compare scenarios from spatial optimization models to achieve conservation targets by: 1) area requirements for conserving >30% abundance of each species for each week of the year independently vs. combined; 2) including vs. ignoring spatial clustering of species abundance; and 3) incorporating vs. avoiding human-dominated landscapes. Solutions integrating information across the year require 56% less area than those integrating weekly abundances, with additional reductions when shared-use landscapes are included. Although incorporating spatial population structure requires more area, geographical representation among priority sites improves substantially. These findings illustrate that globally-sourced citizen science data can elucidate key trade-offs among opportunity costs and spatiotemporal representation of conservation efforts.},

However, little is known about how stopover habitat, essential for refuelling during migration, affects the population dynamics of migratory species. Using 20 years of continent-wide citizen science data, we assess population trends of ten shorebird taxa that refuel on Yellow Sea tidal mudflats, a threatened ecosystem that has shrunk by >65% in recent decades. Seven of the taxa declined at rates of up to 8% per year. Taxa with the greatest reliance on the Yellow Sea as a stopover site showed the greatest declines, whereas those that stop primarily in other regions had slowly declining or stable populations. Decline rate was unaffected by shared evolutionary history among taxa and was not predicted by migration distance, breeding range size, non-breeding location, generation time or body size. These results suggest that changes in stopover habitat can severely limit migratory populations.},

Shorebirds are excellent model organisms for understanding ecological, behavioural and evolutionary processes and are often used as indicators of wetland health. A global team of experienced shorebird researchers identified 45 issues facing these shorebird populations, and divided them into three categories (natural, current anthropogenic and future issues). The natural issues included megatsunamis, volcanoes and regional climate changes, while current anthropogenic threats encompassed agricultural intensification, conversion of tidal flats and coastal wetlands by human infrastructure developments and eutrophication of coastal systems. Possible future threats to shorebirds include microplastics, new means of recreation and infectious diseases. We suggest that this review process be broadened to other taxa to aid the identification and ranking of current and future conservation actions. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Ibis {\textcopyright} 2012 British Ornithologists' Union.},

abstract = {Tracking devices are useful in studying the movement and behaviour of birds throughout the year. However, the effects of device attachment must be monitored for bird welfare and the scientific veracity of information gathered. We report on a trial of three different harness types (leg-loop, body and wing) for attaching GPS devices to Lesser Black-backed Gulls Larus fuscus and of a leg-loop harness on Great Skuas Stercorarius skua. This trial evaluated the functionality of the device whilst deployed, harness retention and the effects of each harness on the birds. The leg-loop harness prevented the devices from charging, due to feathers overlapping their solar panels, and individuals of both species shed this attachment during the first breeding season. For Lesser Black-backed Gull, devices functioned properly when attached using body and wing harnesses; foraging behaviour and territory attendance of birds were similar to the findings of other studies. Despite small sample sizes, annual adult survival rates for Lesser Black-backed Gull were similar to published estimates, suggesting harnesses had no deleterious effects. The wing harness has a smaller amount of skin contact than the body harness, and a non-constricting fit that better accommodates changes in body size. The wing harness was therefore considered the most appropriate for long-term studies.},

Arrival condition was compared with incubation condition in a subset of species. After correction for structural size, body mass was significantly lower at arrival than during incubation in most of the species (but 3-18% above lean mass). Fat index (fat mass/lean mass) varied between 5.1 and 13.2%. Fat stores were estimated to enable survival for 0.6 days for the smallest and 2.5 days for the largest species.

abstract = {Various models, both statistical and non-statistical, which have been proposed for analysing data sets collected in home range studies, are described and compared. These models may be suitable for analysing locational data obtained by such sampling methods as radio tracking or live trapping. The most useful methods for analysing home range data sets involve describing an animal's range by a probability density function of location, called the utilization distribution. Robust methods of estimation of the utilization distribution are related to the estimation of the probability function, Of this type of approach, the method of Ford and Krumme is criticised. The Harmonic Mean method of Dixon and Chapman is shown to be an improper form of the statistical method of kernel estimation. A comparison of the properties of all the models for home range considered here shows that both the Fourier Transform method proposed by D.J. Anderson and the kernel method are good because of their flexibility. The assumption of independence of locational observations which is often made is discussed and shown to be important, especially for data collected by radio tracking. Some limitations of home range studies are considered. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

Methods: Census data of December and January, carried out between 2001/2002 and 2005/2006, were analysed to obtain overwintering population numbers, and thus update the status of Santo{\~{n}}a Marshes for migratory waterbirds. To examine trends, these data were compared with the ones obtained in the same months between 1997/1998 and 2000/2001. The potential influence of temperature in the abundance of waterbirds was also analysed. Results and Conclusions: Santona Marshes supported an average of 19,848 overwintering waterbirds during the analysed period. The total number showed a positive rate of population change between the two analysed periods, this being 46 %. The temperature registered in Santona was correlated with the abundance of some species, but not with the total number of waterbirds. This coastal wetland represents an Area of National Importance during winter for 18 waterbird species. It is also an Area of International Importance for the Icelandic population of black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa islandica. There were significant trends for ten species at Santona Marshes, eight increasing and two decreasing. The increasing trends in the populations of the species under study, along with the improvement in the ecological conditions of the feeding habitat, could explain, in general terms, the population increases of waterbirds registered in Santona Marshes in the last nine years.},

Not all populations are declining, but long-distance migrants (a majority) appear to be at particular risk. Also at risk are sedentary species with small populations, which comprise a majority of the extinct and globally threatened species. The latter are better studied, and threats to their future are relatively well understood. Large-scale population changes in Arctic and north-temperate regions are generally better documented than in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere. The reasons for declines in large and widespread populations are not well understood and explanations are mostly based on sparse and uncoordinated data. The International Waterbird Census (IWC), coordinated by Wetlands International, provides a framework for monitoring non-breeding populations at a global scale. However, wader counts are not yet available from most countries for enough years to allow meaningful population trend analyses. Nevertheless there is considerable potential for trend analyses using IWC data in the future. Many other studies use different and uncoordinated methods. We still lack facilities for broad-scale analyses which would allow the reasons for observed changes in wader populations to be explored. A GIS referenced, decentralised, web-based database interface is proposed which would help explain these changes by linking wader monitoring initiatives, and by providing integration with other environmental monitoring schemes.},

However, as devices develop and are deployed more widely, there is a need to update our knowledge of the potential ethical impacts to allow scientists to balance these against the knowledge gained. We employed a suite of phylogenetically controlled meta-analyses on a dataset comprising more than 450 published effect sizes across 214 different studies to examine the effects of biologger tagging on five key traits in birds. Overall, we found small but significant negative effects of tagging on survival, reproduction, parental care. In addition, tagging was positively associated with foraging trip duration, but had no effect on body mass. Meta-regressions revealed that flying style, migration distance and proportional tag mass were significant influences producing these deleterious effects, with attachment type and position additionally important covariates influencing survival- and reproduction-based effect sizes. There was a positive correlation between the effects of tagging on survival and reproduction, highlighting that effects may be cumulative, with the full effects of tagging not necessarily apparent in studies focused on single traits. We discuss the tradeoff between these negative effects and the advances gained through the use of biologgers. Finally, given the number of studies from our initial literature search that lacked sufficient data for inclusion in analyses, we provide recommendations on the essential information that all biologging studies should report in order to facilitate future assessments of impacts on animals.},

We studied a marked population of the Wandering Tattler Tringa incana, during a three-year period (1997–1999) on nesting grounds in south-central Alaska. Two aspects of our results stand out. First is the previously undescribed preference for tattlers to nest several kilometers removed from pre-nesting feeding areas, mostly in association with both small (kettle) lakes and running water (near small distributaries of major drainages). Second is the apparent use of the study area by cohorts of birds of different breeding status, including (1) local breeders, which defended pre-breeding foraging areas, (2) local non-breeding birds, which remained on the area but were not territorial, and (3) transients that were captured later in the season, but not seen again on the area during the season of capture. We also found that (1) birds tended to nest in clusters despite what appeared to be the ample availability of nesting habitat, (2) they employed an ‘inconspicuous' nesting strategy whereby neither member of a pair betrayed its presence on the nesting area, and (3) females departed the area during early chick-rearing, leaving males to tend broods.},
